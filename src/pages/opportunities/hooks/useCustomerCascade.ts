/**
 * useCustomerCascade — thin re-export of the shared implementation. Promoted to

 * location→department→contact fetch was triplicated across opportunities/
 * candidates/vacancies). Kept as a re-export here so KlantTab/AddOpportunityModal
 * don't need their imports touched — one implementation, consumed from two paths.
